# ALTR_Interview_Task
I use cucumber with Gherkin Language in a feature file to write more understandable user story.
I implemented the actual coding logic with JAVA-SELENIUM-JUNIT inside of my step definitions package, and their related classes.
I trigger the code in my runner class.
Runner class allows me to specifiy which user stories I can run. I easily write @US_1 which represents user story_1.
Hooks class, where we implement some annotations. I used BeforeClass and AfterClass annotattion connect to docker container and closing,respectively.
I also created DataBaseUtilities to make clear code.
